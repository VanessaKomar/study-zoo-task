The task is known as "The (Advanced) Zoo Task" and is being worked on a Miro board.
The TASK DESCRIPTION is what the participants read before the task starts
The RULES of the task are stated below and must be followed.

-- -- -- -- --TASK DESCRIPTION START-- -- -- -- --
You are a zoo keeper tasked with figuring out the public feeding schedule for the animals. 

The map is separated into 6 different sectors, Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple, Brown, and White. These sectors have 4-5 different animals each with a popularity and stress level. There is also an entrance and exit that are located by the Blue sector. The sectors are connected by paths and not all sectors are connected to each other. To get between sectors you must use the paths.

You will have to do two public feedings within an hour for each time of day (see below). These public feedings need to be in two different sectors of the zoo. By the end of the day you will need to have fed animals in all six sectors.
Times of day/Feeding Times
Morning (Not super busy / not too many visitors)
Midday (Somewhat busy / some visitors)
Afternoon (Busiest / most visitors)
Evening (Somewhat busy / some visitors)

Animals with a higher popularity (high popularity) will attract more visitors, increasing your score, however animals with higher stress levels (high stress) will have a lower tolerance for large groups of visitors, decreasing your score.

You should select which animals to feed to give you the highest score. You cannot feed the same animal twice. All animals who are not selected for public feedings will still be fed in private.
In the morning you will start at the entrance and choose which sector to go to from there,  For the next feeding time you will start at the same sector in which you finished feeding the animals in the previous feeding time.and in the evening you will need to end at the exit.
You have one hour to feed two animals.The hour includes the travel and feeding time.The feeding of each animal takes 15 minutes and it takes you 10 minutes to get from one sector to the next.
I.e. from the entrance to the yellow sector you have to pass through two other sectors which means that it takes you 30 minutes to walk from the entrance to the yellow sector
